<!-- The Digitizing Process -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Understanding Logo Digitizing</h2>
  <p>Digitizing is the crucial first step that determines embroidery quality. Here's what goes into converting your logo for stitching:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>What Is Digitizing?</h3>
      <p>Digitizing converts your logo into a stitch file that embroidery machines can read. Unlike printing, embroidery uses thousands of individual stitches to recreate your design. Each stitch direction, density, and sequence must be precisely programmed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>Poor digitizing leads to puckering, thread breaks, and muddy details. Expert digitizing ensures clean edges, proper density, and smooth gradients. We invest the time to get it right so your logo looks professional.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Logo Optimization</h3>
      <p>Some logos need adjustment for embroidery. Very thin lines may need thickening, complex gradients may need simplification, and tiny text may need enlargement. We'll advise on any necessary changes while preserving your brand identity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Size Considerations</h3>
      <p>A logo that looks great at 4" may need modification at 2". We create size-specific digitized versions to ensure your logo looks perfect regardless of placement size.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Stitch Types -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Embroidery Stitch Types</h2>
  <p>Different elements of your logo may use different stitch types. Here's what we work with:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Satin Stitch</h3>
      <p>Smooth, glossy stitches that create clean lines and crisp text. Ideal for borders, lettering, and small details. Satin stitches catch light beautifully, adding dimension to your logo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Fill Stitch</h3>
      <p>Used for covering larger areas with solid color. We carefully select fill patterns and angles to minimize thread usage while maintaining even coverage. Essential for background areas and large shapes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Running Stitch</h3>
      <p>Simple, single-line stitches for outlines and very fine details. Running stitches add definition and can create subtle effects within larger designs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>3D Puff</h3>
      <p>Raised, dimensional embroidery that literally stands out. Foam backing lifts the stitches for a bold, textured effect. Popular for caps and statement pieces.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Placement Guide -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Logo Placement Options</h2>
  <p>Strategic placement maximizes brand visibility while maintaining professional aesthetics.</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Left Chest</h3>
      <p>The most common placement for corporate apparel. Typically 3.5-4" wide, positioned over the heart. Professional, understated, and universally appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Right Chest</h3>
      <p>Often used for secondary logos, employee names, or certifications. Balances left chest branding or stands alone for a different look.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Sleeve</h3>
      <p>Left or right sleeve placement for additional branding. Great for sponsor logos, flags, or secondary brand elements. Visible when arms are crossed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Back Yoke</h3>
      <p>Large-scale branding across the upper back. Excellent visibility at events and trade shows. Can accommodate larger, more detailed designs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What file format do you need for my logo?</summary>
    <p>Vector files (AI, EPS, PDF, SVG) are ideal because they scale without losing quality. We can also work with high-resolution raster images (PNG, JPG) at 300 DPI minimum. If you only have a low-resolution file, our team can often recreate it for an additional fee.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will you match our exact brand colors?</summary>
    <p>Yes! Send us your Pantone codes or brand guidelines, and we'll match your colors precisely. We document these colors for all future orders, ensuring consistency across every item you order.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How long does the process take?</summary>
    <p>New orders typically ship in 5-7 business days after proof approval. Reorders (using existing digitized files) can ship in 3-5 days. Rush service is available for urgent projects—just let us know your deadline.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you provide samples before a large order?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely! For new logos or large orders, we recommend a sample piece. You'll see exactly how your embroidery looks on the actual garment. Sample fees are typically credited toward your final order.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you have minimum order requirements?</summary>
    <p>No minimums! We welcome single-piece orders for samples or personal items. However, per-piece pricing becomes more economical at 12+ pieces due to setup efficiencies.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you embroider items I already own?</summary>
    <p>In most cases, yes. Bring in your existing garments and we'll assess embroidery suitability. Some items (very stretchy fabrics, certain weaves) may present challenges, but we'll be upfront about what will work.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How durable is embroidery?</summary>
    <p>Very durable! Quality embroidery outlasts the garment itself. Our commercial-grade threads resist fading, fraying, and wear. Follow standard washing instructions and your embroidery will look great for years.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if my logo has very fine details?</summary>
    <p>Embroidery has physical limitations—very thin lines and tiny text may need adjustment. Our digitizing team will advise if modifications are needed and show you options that preserve your brand identity while ensuring quality results.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you add employee names to uniforms?</summary>
    <p>Yes! We offer name personalization for uniforms. Provide your roster and we'll embroider individual names on each garment. This is popular for restaurant staff, medical offices, and service teams.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you offer local pickup in Atlanta?</summary>
    <p>Yes! Local customers can pick up orders directly. We serve all of metro Atlanta including Midtown, Buckhead, Decatur, Marietta, and surrounding areas. We can also arrange local delivery for large orders.</p>
