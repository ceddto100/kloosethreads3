  <div class="hero-desc hero-glow">
    <p>From rough sketches to polished logos, we transform your ideas into stitch-perfect embroidery. Let's create something extraordinary together.</p>
  </div>
  <a class="hero-cta" href="/#contact">Start Your Design</a>
</section>

<!-- Introduction -->
<section class="content container">
  <h2>We Bring Your Ideas to Life</h2>
  <p>Every great embroidered design starts with an idea. Maybe you have a napkin sketch, a vision in your head, or an old logo that needs a refresh. Whatever your starting point, our design team collaborates with you to create embroidery that exceeds your expectations.</p>
  <p>Custom design isn't just about making things look pretty—it's about understanding your brand, your message, and your goals. We combine artistic creativity with deep technical knowledge of embroidery to ensure your design doesn't just look good on screen, but translates beautifully into thread.</p>
</section>

<!-- Why Custom Design -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Why Work with Our Design Team?</h2>
  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Embroidery Expertise</h3>
      <p>Our designers understand the unique constraints and possibilities of embroidery. We don't just make designs—we make designs that stitch perfectly. No surprises, no disappointments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Collaborative Process</h3>
      <p>We work with you, not just for you. Every step involves your input and approval. We share ideas, present options, and refine until you're completely satisfied.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Technical Translation</h3>
      <p>We bridge the gap between digital design and physical embroidery. Line weights, color transitions, small details—we know what works and what doesn't.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Brand Consistency</h3>
      <p>Your embroidered design will perfectly match your existing brand identity. We ensure colors, proportions, and styling remain consistent across all applications.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- What You Can Bring -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>What You Can Bring to Us</h2>
  <p>Don't worry if your starting point is rough—we've worked with everything imaginable:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Rough Sketches</h3>
      <p>Napkin drawings, whiteboard photos, pencil sketches—if you can capture your idea in any form, we can work with it. Don't be embarrassed; some of our best work started as simple doodles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Existing Logos</h3>
      <p>Have a logo that needs updating for embroidery? Many print logos don't translate well to thread without modification. We optimize existing designs for the embroidery medium.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Reference Images</h3>
      <p>Found a style you like? Send us photos, screenshots, or links. "I want something like this" gives us a great starting point to understand your aesthetic preferences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Text Ideas</h3>
      <p>Just have words? We can design around text—company names, taglines, commemorative dates. We'll suggest fonts, layouts, and decorative elements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Mood Boards</h3>
      <p>Pinterest boards, Instagram saves, collected images—visual references help us understand your style. The more context you provide, the better we can match your vision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Brand Guidelines</h3>
      <p>If you have established brand colors, fonts, or style guides, share them. We'll ensure your embroidery fits seamlessly into your existing brand identity.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- The Design Process -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Our Design Process</h2>
  <p>From first conversation to final stitch, here's how we work together:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>1. Discovery Call</h3>
      <p>We start with a conversation about your project. What's your vision? What's the intended use? Who's your audience? This context shapes everything that follows.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>2. Gather Materials</h3>
      <p>Share whatever you have—sketches, references, brand guidelines, inspiration images. The more context we have, the better we understand your direction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>3. Concept Development</h3>
      <p>Our design team creates initial concepts based on your input. We explore different directions and approaches to find what resonates with your vision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>4. Concept Review</h3>
      <p>We present concepts and gather your feedback. What do you love? What needs adjustment? This collaborative review shapes the next iteration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>5. Refinement</h3>
      <p>Based on your feedback, we refine the chosen direction. Multiple revision rounds ensure we get every detail right before moving to production.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>6. Digitizing</h3>
      <p>Once design is approved, we convert it to a stitch-ready file. This technical process programs every stitch for optimal embroidery results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>7. Sample Approval</h3>
      <p>We stitch a physical sample on your actual garment type. You see exactly how the design looks in thread before full production begins.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>8. Production</h3>
      <p>With your approval, we move to full production. Your design is stored permanently for easy reorders whenever you need more embroidered items.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Design Considerations -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Embroidery Design Considerations</h2>
  <p>Great embroidery design requires understanding certain technical realities:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Detail Limitations</h3>
      <p>Embroidery thread has physical thickness—extremely fine lines and tiny text don't translate well. We advise on minimum sizes and detail levels for clear results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Color Simplification</h3>
      <p>Unlike printing, embroidery can't reproduce gradients or photographic images. We simplify color palettes and create thread-appropriate designs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Size Matters</h3>
      <p>A design that works at 4" may need modification at 2". We create size-specific versions to ensure your design looks great at every application size.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Fabric Considerations</h3>
      <p>Different fabrics require different approaches. Stretchy fabrics, thick canvas, delicate silks—we adjust designs and digitizing for optimal results on your chosen material.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- File Formats -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>File Formats We Accept</h2>
  <p>We can work with virtually any file type—but some are better than others:</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Ideal (Vector)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI</strong> - Adobe Illustrator</li>
        <li><strong>EPS</strong> - Encapsulated PostScript</li>
        <li><strong>PDF</strong> - Portable Document Format</li>
        <li><strong>SVG</strong> - Scalable Vector Graphics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Vector files scale infinitely without quality loss. These are ideal for logo work and produce the best embroidery results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Acceptable (Raster)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PNG</strong> - Portable Network Graphics</li>
        <li><strong>JPG</strong> - JPEG images</li>
        <li><strong>TIFF</strong> - Tagged Image File Format</li>
        <li><strong>PSD</strong> - Photoshop Document</li>
      </ul>
      <p>High-resolution raster files (300 DPI minimum) can work well. Lower resolution may require recreation or cause quality issues.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>We Can Work With</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketches and drawings</li>
        <li>Phone photos</li>
        <li>Screenshots</li>
        <li>Reference images</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even rough materials can be starting points. If you have an idea, we can translate it into professional design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>What You'll Receive</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stitch file (.DST, .PES, etc.)</li>
        <li>Vector logo file (if created)</li>
        <li>Color specification document</li>
        <li>Size/placement guide</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We provide everything needed for production and future reorders, securely stored on file.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you work from a rough sketch or idea?</summary>

  </details>

  <details>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will you match our existing brand colors?</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>How long does the design process take?</summary>
    <p>Simple optimization: 2-3 business days. New design creation: 5-10 business days depending on complexity. Rush service available for urgent projects—just let us know your deadline.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if my logo has complex gradients or photographic elements?</summary>
    <p>Embroidery can't reproduce gradients or photographs directly. We'll advise on simplification options that maintain your brand identity while working within embroidery's capabilities. Often, simplified versions look even better in thread.</p>
  </details>

  </details>

  <details>
