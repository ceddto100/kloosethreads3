<section class="container">
  <h2>Why Atlanta Chooses KlooseThreads for Hat Embroidery</h2>
  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Precision Digitizing</h3>
      <p>Our in-house digitizing team optimizes your logo specifically for hat embroidery. We adjust stitch density, underlay, and pathing to ensure crisp details on curved surfaces—no puckering, no distortion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Premium Thread Quality</h3>
      <p>We use only commercial-grade polyester and rayon threads that resist fading, fraying, and washing. Your embroidery will look as vibrant after 100 washes as it did on day one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Pantone Color Matching</h3>
      <p>Brand consistency matters. We match your exact Pantone colors and keep them on file, ensuring every reorder is identical to your original—no guesswork, no variations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Fast Turnaround</h3>
      <p>Standard orders ship in 5-7 business days. Need it faster? Our rush service can get your hats ready in as little as 48 hours for those last-minute events.</p>

<!-- Cap Types -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Hat Styles We Embroider</h2>
  <p>No matter your style preference, we've got you covered. Each hat type presents unique embroidery challenges—and we've mastered them all.</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Dad Hats & Baseball Caps</h3>
      <p>The classic choice for casual branding. Unstructured crowns require careful tension control to prevent puckering. We use specialized hooping techniques for a clean, professional finish every time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft, relaxed fit</li>
        <li>Adjustable strap closure</li>
        <li>Ideal for: restaurants, breweries, retail</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Snapbacks & Flatbrims</h3>
      <p>Structured panels provide a perfect canvas for bold logos and detailed artwork. Popular with sports teams, streetwear brands, and promotional campaigns.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rigid front panels</li>
        <li>Flat or curved brim options</li>
        <li>Ideal for: teams, events, merchandise</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Trucker Caps</h3>
      <p>The foam front panel makes these hats perfect for vibrant, high-contrast embroidery. Mesh back keeps wearers cool while your logo stays front and center.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foam front panel</li>
        <li>Breathable mesh back</li>
        <li>Ideal for: outdoor events, summer promos</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Beanies & Winter Hats</h3>
      <p>Knit materials require specialized techniques to prevent thread from pulling through. We use proper backing and tension settings for clean embroidery on stretchy fabrics.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cuffed or slouch styles</li>
        <li>Acrylic, wool, or fleece</li>
        <li>Ideal for: winter events, corporate gifts</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

<!-- Placement Options -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Embroidery Placement Options</h2>
  <p>Strategic placement makes all the difference. We'll help you choose the optimal position for maximum visibility and aesthetic appeal.</p>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Front Center</h3>
      <p>The most popular choice—your logo takes center stage. Best for primary branding and maximum visibility. We recommend designs up to 4" wide for optimal proportions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Side Panel</h3>
      <p>Perfect for secondary logos, small text, or sponsor branding. Left or right side placement adds visual interest without competing with front artwork.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Back Arc</h3>
      <p>Ideal for text-based designs like team names, locations, or taglines. Curved text follows the hat's natural shape for a professional, balanced look.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>3D Puff Embroidery</h3>
      <p>Want your logo to literally stand out? Puff embroidery adds dimension with raised lettering. Popular for sports teams and bold brand statements.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

      <h3>3. Sample Approval</h3>
      <p>For new designs or large orders, we can provide a physical sample for your approval. See exactly how your embroidery will look before committing to the full run.</p>

<!-- Pricing -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Transparent Pricing</h2>

  <div class="about-blocks">
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Stitch Count</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Quantity</h3>
      <p>Volume discounts kick in at 12, 24, 50, and 100+ pieces. The more you order, the lower your per-piece cost. Planning a large order? Ask about custom bulk pricing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Hat Supply</h3>
      <p>Bring your own blanks or choose from our catalog of quality caps. We stock popular brands and can source specific styles upon request.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="container">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How much does hat embroidery cost?</summary>
    <p>Typical pricing ranges from $10-$18 per hat depending on stitch count, quantity, and whether you supply the hats. First-time orders include a one-time digitizing fee of $25-$75. Volume discounts available at 12, 24, 50, and 100+ pieces. Contact us for an exact quote.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you match my exact brand colors?</summary>
    <p>Yes! We match Pantone colors precisely and keep them on file for all future orders. Send us your brand guidelines or Pantone codes, and we'll ensure consistent color matching across every hat and reorder.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What's the turnaround time?</summary>
    <p>Standard orders ship in 5-7 business days after proof approval. Rush service is available for urgent projects—we can turn around orders in as little as 48 hours. Let us know your deadline and we'll make it happen.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you supply the hats or should I bring my own?</summary>
    <p>Both options work! We stock a variety of quality blank hats from trusted brands, or you can provide your own. If sourcing specific styles, let us know and we can order them for you or recommend where to purchase.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What file format do you need for my logo?</summary>
    <p>Vector files (AI, EPS, PDF) are ideal as they scale without losing quality. However, we can work with high-resolution PNG or JPG files (300 DPI minimum). If you only have a low-res file, our digitizing team can recreate it—just ask.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What's the minimum order quantity?</summary>
    <p>No minimum! We welcome single-hat orders for samples or personal projects. However, per-piece pricing is most economical at 12+ pieces due to setup time. Contact us to discuss your specific needs.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you do 3D puff embroidery?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely! 3D puff embroidery creates raised, dimensional lettering that really pops. It works best for bold, simple designs and text. We'll advise if your artwork is suitable for puff embroidery during the quoting process.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you offer samples before a large order?</summary>
    <p>Yes! For new designs or orders of 50+ pieces, we recommend a physical sample. You'll see exactly how your embroidery looks before committing to the full production run. Sample fees are typically credited toward your final order.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I care for embroidered hats?</summary>
    <p>Hand washing in cold water is gentlest, but most embroidered hats handle the washing machine fine on a gentle cycle. Air dry to maintain shape. Avoid bleach and high heat. Our quality stitching is built to last through regular washing.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can you embroider on hats I already own?</summary>
    <p>In most cases, yes! Bring in your existing hats and we'll assess them. Some older or worn hats may not be suitable, but we'll be upfront about what will and won't work before you commit.</p>
